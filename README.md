## Technology
- Spring Boot
- Vanilla Javascript
- Bootstrap5
- PostgreSQL
- Java
- Spring Dependencies: Spring Web, Thymeleaf, Data JPA, and PostgreSQL Driver

UCanoeIt was built using Spring Boot.

For the front-end, I used the Spring Web and Thymeleaf dependencies for server-side rendering, Bootstrap5 for styling, and some Vanilla Javascript for functionality.

For the back-end, I used the Spring Data JPA dependency which includes hibernate for data persistence and route mapping.  I also used the PostgreSQL Driver dependency since the database was built in Postgres to easily connect UCanoeIt to itâ€™s database.
